♻️ Waste Classification Model – Smart Image-Based Segregation
This project is a deep learning-powered solution aimed at tackling one of the most persistent problems in urban management: waste segregation. Designed using Python and TensorFlow, this model classifies waste images into recyclable and non-recyclable categories to promote efficient sorting and eco-friendly disposal.

📂 Key Features
🔍 Image-Based Classification: Uses a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze and classify waste based on visual data.
📸 Dataset Utilization: Trained on a labeled dataset containing various types of garbage images (e.g., plastic, paper, organic).
🧠 Model Architecture: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras with layers fine-tuned for waste classification accuracy.
🧪 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss/accuracy plots for monitoring training performance.
📁 Organized Structure: Clean directory with training, testing, and preprocessing scripts.
⚙️ Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to boost model generalization.
